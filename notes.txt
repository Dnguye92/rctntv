REACT vs REACT NATIVE
    - React
        - Knows how a component should behave
        - Knows how to take a bunch of components and make them work together

    - React Native
        - Knows how to take the output from a component and render it on the screen
        - Provides default core components (images, text)

CREATING A COMPONENT WITH JSX
    - A component is an object that produces something that can be rendered to the screen
    - Each js file should only have ONE component
REGISTERING A COMPONENT
    - The .registryComponent() is a method that is used from the React Native library that allows us to render our app - which takes two arguments
        - First argument is string that is the name of the project. So if the name of your project was Poop then the first argument would be 'poop'
        - Second argument is the function that will pass the component that you want to render to the app
        - For every ReactNative app - you must register at least one component
        - Only the root component uses AppRegistry()

DESTRUCTURING IMPORTS
    - Import destructuring means to import certain properties from a library

STYLING WITH REACT
    - Instead of creating a stylsheet for all of the css, we add css to each components file

MORE STYLING COMPONENTS
    - We can use the View property that we will import from ReactNative
    - We will be using Flexbox

MAKING THE HEADER REUSABLE
    - we use "props" to pass properties between parent components and child components
    - props are objects that help manipulate the data generated by components

MAKING CLASS BASED COMPONENTS
    - FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS
        - used for presenting static data
        - can't handle fetching data
        - easy to write
        - const Header = () => {
            return <Text>Bruh</Text>
        }
    - CLASS COMPONENTS
        - used for dynamic sources of data
        - handles any data that might change (fetching data, user events)
        - knows when it gets rendered to the device
        - more code to write
        - class Header extends Component {
            render() {
                return <Text>Bruh</Text>
            }
        }
        - must include a render method that returns some amount of JSX
